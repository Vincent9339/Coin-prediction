# Coin Prediction using RNN
Welcome to the Coin Prediction project! This mini project demonstrates how to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the next outcome in a sequence of coin (heads or tails). This is a simple yet illustrative example of how RNNs can be applied to sequential data.

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to build an RNN model that can predict the next outcome in a series of coins. The project serves as a fun and educational introduction to sequential modeling techniques using RNNs.

### Features
- Implements a simple RNN for sequence prediction.
- Scripts for training, evaluating, and making predictions with the model.
- Model visualization and accuracy reporting using **matplotlib** and **go.Figure**
